# Linear Regression and Model Selection

This chapter severs several purposes. First, we will review some basic knowledge of linear regression. This includes the concept of vector space, projection, which leads to estimating parameters of a linear regression. Most of these knowledge are covered in the prerequisite so you shouldn't find these concepts too difficult to understand. Secondly, we will mainly use the `lm()` function as an example to demonstrate some features of `R`. This includes extracting results, visualizations, handling categorical variables, prediction and model selection. These concepts will be useful for other models. Finally, we will introduce several model selection criteria and  algorithms to perform model selection. 

## Example: real estate data 

This [Real Estate data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set) [@yeh2018building] is provided on the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The goal of this dataset is to predict the unit house price based on six different covariates: 

  * `date`: The transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)
  * `age`: The house age (unit: year)
  * `distance`: The distance to the nearest MRT station (unit: meter)
  * `stores`: The number of convenience stores in the living circle on foot (integer)
  * `latitude`: Latitude (unit: degree)
  * `longitude`: Longitude (unit: degree)
  * `price`: House price of unit area

```{r}
    realestate = read.csv("data/realestate.csv", row.names = 1)

    library(DT)
    datatable(realestate, filter = "top", rownames = FALSE,
              options = list(pageLength = 8))
    
    dim(realestate)
```

## Notation and Basic Properties

We usually denote the observed covariates data as the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$, with dimension $n \times p$. Hence in this case, the dimension of $\mathbf{X}$ is $414 \times 7$. The $j$th variable is simply the $j$th column of this matrix, which is denoted as $\mathbf{x}_j$. The outcome $\mathbf{y}$ (`price`) is a vector of length $414$. Please note that we usually use a "bold" symbol to represent a vector, while for a single element (scalar), such as the $j$th variable of subject $i$, we use $x_{ij}$.

A linear regression concerns modeling the relationship (in matrix form)

$$\by_{n \times 1} = \bX_{n \times p} \bbeta_{p \times 1} + \bepsilon_{n \times 1}$$
And we know that the solution is obtained by minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS):

$$ 
\begin{align}
\widehat{\bbeta} &= \underset{\bbeta}{\argmin} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i - x_i^\T \bbeta \right)^2 \\
&= \underset{\bbeta}{\argmin} \big( \mathbf y - \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol \beta \big)^\T \big( \mathbf y - \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol \beta \big)
\end{align}
$$
Classic solution can be obtained by taking the derivative of RSS w.r.t $\bbeta$ and set it to zero. This leads to the well known normal equation: 

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \bbeta} &= -2 \bX^\T (\by - \bX \bbeta) \doteq 0 \\
    \Longrightarrow \quad \bX^\T \by &= \bX^\T \bX \bbeta
\end{align}
$$
Assuming that $\bX$ is full rank, then $\bX^\T \bX$ is invertible. Then, we have 

$$
\widehat{\bbeta} = (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1}\bX^\T \by
$$
Some additional concepts are frequently used. The fitted values $\widehat{\by}$ are essentially the prediction of the original $n$ training data points:

$$ 
\begin{align}
\widehat{\by} =& \bX \bbeta\\
=& \underbrace{\bX (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1}\bX^\T}_{\bH} \by \\
\doteq& \bH_{n \times n} \by 
\end{align}
$$
where $\bH$ is called the "hat" matrix. It is a projection matrix that projects any vector ($\by$ in our case) onto the column space of $\bX$. A project matrix enjoys two properties 

  * Symmetric: $\bH^\T = \bH$
  * Idempotent $\bH\bH = \bH$

The residuals $\br$ can also be obtained using the hat matrix:

$$ \br = \by - \widehat{\by} = (\bI - \bH) \by$$
From the properties of a projection matrix, we also know that $\br$ should be orthogonal to any vector from the column space of $\bX$. Hence, 

$$\bX^\T \br = \mathbf{0}_{p \times 1}$$

The residuals is also used to estimate the error variance:

$$\widehat\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-p} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 = \frac{\text{RSS}}{n-p}$$
When the data are indeed generated from a linear model, and with suitable conditions on the design matrix and random errors $\bepsilon$, we can conclude that $\widehat{\bbeta}$ is an __unbiased__ estimator of $\bbeta$. Its variance-covariance matrix satisfies

$$
\begin{align}
    \Var(\widehat{\bbeta}) &= \Var\big( (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1}\bX^\T \by \big) \nonumber \\
    &= \Var\big( (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1}\bX^\T (\bX \bbeta + \bepsilon) \big) \nonumber \\
    &= \Var\big( (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1}\bX^\T \bepsilon) \big) \nonumber \\
    &= (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1}\bX^\T \bX (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1} \bI \sigma^2 \nonumber \\
    &= (\bX^\T \bX)^{-1}\sigma^2
\end{align}
$$
All of the above mentioned results are already implemented in R through the `lm()` function to fit a linear regression. 

## Using the `lm()` Function

Let's consider a simple regression that uses `age` and `distance` to model `price`. We will save the fitted object as `lm.fit`

```{r}
    lm.fit = lm(price ~ age + distance, data = realestate)
```

This syntax contains three components:

  * `data = ` specifies the dataset
  * The outcome variable should be on the left hand side of `~` 
  * The covariates should be on the right hand side of `~`
    
To look at the detailed model fitting results, use the `summary()` function 

```{r}
    lm.summary = summary(lm.fit)
    lm.summary
```

This shows that both `age` and `distance` are highly significant for predicting the price. In fact, this fitted object (`lm.fit`) and the summary object (`lm.summary`) are both saved as a list. This is pretty common to handle an output object with many things involved. We may peek into this object to see what are provided using a `$` after the object. 

<center>
![](images/reactive.png){width=40%}
</center>

The `str()` function can also display all the items in a list. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
    str(lm.summary)
```

Usually, printing out the summary is sufficient. However, further details can be useful for other purposes. For example, if we interested in the residual vs. fits plot, we may use 

```{r}
    plot(lm.fit$fitted.values, lm.fit$residuals, 
         xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals",
         col = "darkorange", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
```

It seems that the error variance is not constant (as a function of the fitted values), hence additional techniques may be required to handle this issue. However, that is beyond the scope of this book. 

### Adding Covariates

It is pretty simple if we want to include additional variables. This is usually done by connecting them with the `+` sign on the right hand side of `~`. R also provide convenient ways to include interactions and higher order terms. The following code with the interaction term between `age` and `distance`, and a squared term of `distance` should be self-explanatory. 

```{r}
    lm.fit2 = lm(price ~ age + distance + age*distance + I(distance^2), data = realestate)
    summary(lm.fit2)
```

If you choose to include all covariates presented in the data, then simply use `.` on the right hand side of `~`. However, you should always be careful when doing this because some dataset would contain meaningless variables such as subject ID. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
    lm.fit3 = lm(price ~ ., data = realestate)
```

### Categorical Variables

The `store` variable has several different values. We can see that it has 11 different values. One strategy is to model this as a continuous variable. However, we may also consider to discretize it. For example, we may create a new variable, say `store.cat`, defined as follows

```{r}
  table(realestate$stores)

  # define a new factor variable
  realestate$store.cat = as.factor((realestate$stores > 0) + (realestate$stores > 4))
  table(realestate$store.cat)
  levels(realestate$store.cat) = c("None", "Several", "Many")
  head(realestate$store.cat)
```

This variable is defined as a factor, which is often used for categorical variables. Since this variable has three different categories, if we include it in the linear regression, it will introduce two additional variables (using the third as the reference):

```{r}
    lm.fit3 = lm(price ~ age + distance + store.cat, data = realestate)
    summary(lm.fit3)
```

There are usually two types of categorical variables:

  * Ordinal: the numbers representing each category is ordered, e.g., how many stores in the neighborhood. Oftentimes nominal data can be treated as a continuous variable.
  * Nominal: they are not ordered and can be represented using either numbers or letters, e.g., ethnic group. 
  
The above example is treating `store.cat` as a nominal variable, and the `lm()` function is using dummy variables for each category. This should be our default approach to handle nominal variables. 

## Model Selection Criteria

We will use the `diabetes` dataset from the `lars` package as a demonstration of model selection. Ten baseline variables include age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. These measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the outcome of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. More details are available in @efron2004least. Our goal is to select a linear model, preferably with a small number of variables, that can predict the outcome. To select the best model, commonly used strategies include Marrow's $C_p$, AIC (Akaike information criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion). Further derivations will be provide at a later section. 

```{r}
    # load the diabetes data
    library(lars)
    data(diabetes)
    diab = data.frame(cbind(diabetes$x, "Y" = diabetes$y))

    # fit linear regression with all covariates
    lm.fit = lm(Y~., data=diab)
```

The idea of model selection is to apply some penalty on the number of parameters used in the model. In general, they are usually in the form of 

$$\text{Goodness-of-Fit} + \text{Complexity Penality}$$

### Using Marrows' $C_p$

For example, the Marrows' $C_p$ criterion minimize the following quantity (a derivation is provided at Section \@ref(marrows-cp)): 

$$\text{RSS} + 2 p \widehat\sigma_{\text{full}}^2$$
Note that the $\sigma_{\text{full}}^2$ refers to the residual variance estimation based on the full model, i.e., will all variables. Hence, this formula cannot be used when $p > n$ because you would not be able to obtain a valid estimation of $\sigma_{\text{full}}^2$. Nonetheless, we can calculate this quantity with the diabetes dataset

```{r}
    # number of variables (including intercept)
    p = 11
    n = nrow(diab)
      
    # obtain residual sum of squares
    RSS = sum(residuals(lm.fit)^2)
    
    # use the formula directly to calculate the Cp criterion 
    Cp = RSS + 2*p*summary(lm.fit)$sigma^2
    Cp
```

We can compare this with another sub-model, say, with just `age` and `glu`:

```{r}
    lm.fit_sub = lm(Y~ age + glu, data=diab)
  
    # obtain residual sum of squares
    RSS_sub = sum(residuals(lm.fit_sub)^2)
    
    # use the formula directly to calculate the Cp criterion 
    Cp_sub = RSS_sub + 2*3*summary(lm.fit)$sigma^2
    Cp_sub
```

Comparing this with the previous one, the full model is better. 

### Using AIC and BIC

Calculating the AIC and BIC criteria in `R` is a lot simpler, with the existing functions. The AIC score is given by 

$$-2 \text{Log-likelihood} + 2 p,$$
while the BIC score is given by 

$$-2 \text{Log-likelihood} + \log(n) p,$$

Interestingly, when assuming that the error distribution is Gaussian, the log-likelihood part is just a function of the RSS. In general, AIC performs similarly to $C_p$, while BIC tend to select a much smaller set due to the larger penalty. Theoretically, both AIC and $C_p$ are interested in the prediction error, regardless of whether the model is specified correctly, while BIC is interested in selecting the true set of variables, while assuming that the true model is being considered. 

The AIC score can be done using the `AIC()` function. We can match this result by writing out the normal density function and plug in the estimated parameters. Note that this requires one additional parameter, which is the variance. Hence the total number of parameters is 12. We can calculate this with our own code:

```{r}
    # ?AIC
    # a build-in function for calculating AIC using -2log likelihood
    AIC(lm.fit) 

    # Match the result
    n*log(RSS/n) + n + n*log(2*pi) + 2 + 2*p
```

Alternatively, the `extractAIC()` function can calculate both AIC and BIC. However, note that the `n + n*log(2*pi) + 2` part in the above code does not change regardless of how many parameters we use. Hence, this quantify does not affect the comparison between different models. Then we can safely remove this part and only focus on the essential ones. 

```{r}
    # ?extractAIC
    # AIC for the full model
    extractAIC(lm.fit)
    n*log(RSS/n) + 2*p

    # BIC for the full model
    extractAIC(lm.fit, k = log(n))
    n*log(RSS/n) + log(n)*p
```

Now, we can compare AIC or BIC using of two different models and select whichever one that gives a smaller value. For example the AIC of the previous sub-model is 

```{r}
    # AIC for the sub-model
    extractAIC(lm.fit_sub)
```

## Model Selection Algorithms

In previous examples, we have to manually fit two models and calculate their respective selection criteria and compare them. This is a rather tedious process if we have many variables and a huge number of combinations to consider. To automatically compare different models and select the best one, there are two common computational approaches: best subset regression and step-wise regression. As their name suggest, the best subset selection will exhaust all possible combination of variables, while the step-wise regression would adjust the model by adding or subtracting one variable at a time to reach the best model. 

### Best Subset Selection with `leaps`

Since the penalty is only affected by the number of variables, we may first choose the best model with the smallest RSS for each model size, and then compare across these models by attaching the penalty terms of their corresponding sizes. The `leaps` package can be used to calculate the best model of each model size. It essentially performs an exhaustive search, however, still utilizing some tricks to skip some really bad models. Note that the `leaps` package uses the data matrix directly, instead of specifying a formula.  

```{r}
    library(leaps)
    
    # The package specifies the X matrix and outcome y vector
    RSSleaps = regsubsets(x = as.matrix(diab[, -11]), y = diab[, 11])
    summary(RSSleaps, matrix=T)
```

The results is summarized in a matrix, with each row representing a model size. The `"*"` sign indicates that the variable is include in the model for the corresponding size. Hence, there should be only one of such in the first row, two in the second row, etc. 
    
By default, the algorithm would only consider models up to size 8. This is controlled by the argument `nvmax`. If we want to consider larger model sizes, then set this to a larger number. However, be careful that this many drastically increase the computational cost. 

```{r}    
    # Consider maximum of 10 variables
    RSSleaps = regsubsets(x = as.matrix(diab[, -11]), y = diab[, 11], nvmax = 10)
    summary(RSSleaps,matrix=T)
    
    # Obtain the matrix that indicates the variables
    sumleaps = summary(RSSleaps, matrix = T)
    
    # This object includes the RSS results, which is needed to calculate the scores
    sumleaps$rss
    
    # This matrix indicates whether a variable is in the best model(s)
    sumleaps$which
    
    # The package automatically produces the Cp statistic
    sumleaps$cp
```

We can calculate different model selection criteria with the best models of each size. The model fitting result already produces the $C_p$ and BIC results. However, please note that both quantities are modified slightly. For the $C_p$ statistics, the quantity is divided by the estimated error variance, and also adjust for the sample size. For the BIC, the difference is a constant regardless of the model size. Hence these difference do will not affect the model selection result because the modification is the same regardless of the number of variables. 
```{r}
    modelsize=apply(sumleaps$which,1,sum)
    
    Cp = sumleaps$rss/(summary(lm.fit)$sigma^2) + 2*modelsize - n;
    AIC = n*log(sumleaps$rss/n) + 2*modelsize;
    BIC = n*log(sumleaps$rss/n) + modelsize*log(n);
    
    # Comparing the Cp scores 
    cbind("Our Cp" = Cp, "leaps Cp" = sumleaps$cp) 
    
    # Comparing the BIC results. The difference is a constant, 
    # which is the score of an intercept model
    cbind("Our BIC" = BIC, "leaps BIC" = sumleaps$bic, 
          "Difference" = BIC-sumleaps$bic, 
          "Intercept Score" = n*log(sum((diab[,11] - mean(diab[,11]))^2/n)))
```

Finally, we may select the best model, using any of the criteria. The following code would produced a plot to visualize it. We can see that BIC selects 6 variables, while both AIC and $C_p$ selects 7. 

```{r}
    # Rescale Cp, AIC and BIC to (0,1).
    inrange <- function(x) { (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) }
    
    Cp = inrange(Cp)
    BIC = inrange(BIC)
    AIC = inrange(AIC)

    plot(range(modelsize), c(0, 0.4), type="n", 
         xlab="Model Size (with Intercept)", 
         ylab="Model Selection Criteria", cex.lab = 1.5)

    points(modelsize, Cp, col = "green4", type = "b", pch = 19)
    points(modelsize, AIC, col = "orange", type = "b", pch = 19)
    points(modelsize, BIC, col = "purple", type = "b", pch = 19)
    legend("topright", legend=c("Cp", "AIC", "BIC"),
           col=c("green4", "orange", "purple"), 
           lty = rep(1, 3), pch = 19, cex = 1.7)
```

### Step-wise regression using `step()`

The idea of step-wise regression is very simple: we start with a certain model (e.g. the intercept or the full mode), and add or subtract one variable at a time by making the best decision to improve the model selection score. The `step()` function implements this procedure. The following example starts with the full model and uses AIC as the selection criteria (default of the function). After removing several variables, the model ends up with six predictors.  

```{r}
    # k = 2 (AIC) is default; 
    step(lm.fit, direction="both", k = 2)
```

We can also use different settings, such as which model to start with, which is the minimum/maximum model, and do we allow to adding/subtracting. 

```{r}
    # use BIC (k = log(n))instead of AIC
    # trace = 0 will suppress the output of intermediate steps 
    step(lm.fit, direction="both", k = log(n), trace=0)

    # Start with an intercept model, and use forward selection (adding only)
    step(lm(Y~1, data=diab), scope=list(upper=lm.fit, lower=~1), 
         direction="forward", trace=0)
```

We can see that these results are slightly different from the best subset selection. So which is better? Of course the best subset selection is better because it considers all possible candidates, which step-wise regression may stuck at a sub-optimal model, while adding and subtracting any variable do not benefit further. Hence, the results of step-wise regression may be unstable. On the other hand, best subset selection not really feasible for high-dimensional problems because of the computational cost. 

## Derivation of Marrows' $C_p$ {#marrows-cp}

Suppose we have a set of training data $\cD_n = \{x_i, \color{DodgerBlue}{y_i}\}_{i=1}^n$ and a set of testing data, with the same covariates $\cD_n^\ast = \{x_i, \color{OrangeRed}{y_i^\ast}\}_{i=1}^n$. Hence, this is an __in-sample prediction__ problem. However, the $\color{OrangeRed}{y_i^\ast}$s are newly observed. Assuming that the data are generated from a linear model, i.e., in vector form,

\def\rby{\color{OrangeRed}{\by^\ast}}
\def\rbe{\color{OrangeRed}{\be^\ast}}
\def\rbbeta{\color{OrangeRed}{\widehat{\bbeta}}}

\def\bby{\color{DodgerBlue}{\by}}
\def\bbe{\color{DodgerBlue}{\be}}
\def\bbbeta{\color{DodgerBlue}{\widehat{\bbeta}}}


$$\bby = \bmu + \bbe = \bX \bbeta + \bbe,$$
and
$$\rby = \bmu + \rbe = \bX \bbeta + \rbe,$$
where the error terms are i.i.d with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$. We want to know what is the best model that predicts $\rby$. Let's look at the testing error first:

\begin{align}
\E[\color{OrangeRed}{\text{Testing Error}}] =& ~\E \lVert \rby - \bX \bbbeta \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert (\rby - \bX \bbeta) + (\bX \bbeta - \bX \bbbeta) \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert \rbe \rVert^2 + \E \lVert \bX (\bbbeta - \bbeta) \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\color{OrangeRed}{n \sigma^2} + \E \big[ \Trace \big( (\bbbeta - \bbeta)^\T \bX^\T \bX (\bbbeta - \bbeta) \big) \big] \\
=& ~\color{OrangeRed}{n \sigma^2} + \Trace\big(\bX^\T \bX \Cov(\bbbeta)\big) \\
=& ~\color{OrangeRed}{n \sigma^2} + \color{DodgerBlue}{p \sigma^2}.
\end{align}

In the above, we used properties

  * $\Trace(ABC) = \Trace(CAB)$
  * $\E[\Trace(A)] = \Trace(\E[A])$

On the other hand, the training error is 

\begin{align}
\E[\color{DodgerBlue}{\text{Training Error}}] =& ~\E \lVert \br \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert (\bI - \bH) \bby \lVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert (\bI - \bH)(\bX \bbeta + \bbe) \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert (\bI - \bH)\bbe \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E [\Trace(\bbe^\T(\bI - \bH)^\T (\bI - \bH) \bbe)]\\
=& ~\Trace((\bI - \bH)^\T (\bI - \bH) \Cov(\bbe)]\\
=& ~\color{DodgerBlue}{(n - p) \sigma^2}.
\end{align}

In the above, we further used properties 

  * $\bH$ and $\bI - \bH$ are projection matrices
  * $\bH \bX = \bX$

If we contrast the two results above, the difference between the training and testing errors is $2 p \sigma^2$. Hence, if we can obtain a valid estimation of $\sigma^2$, then the training error plus $2 p \widehat{\sigma}^2$ is a good approximation of the testing error, which we want to minimize. And that is exactly what Marrows' $C_p$ does. 

We can also generalize this result to the case when the underlying model is not a linear model. Assume that

$$\bby = f(\bX) + \bbe = \bmu + \bbe,$$
and
$$\rby = f(\bX) + \rbe = \bmu + \rbe.$$
In this case, a linear model would not estimate $\bmu$. Instead, it is only capable to produce the best linear approximation of $\bmu$ using the columns in $\bX$, which is $\bH\bmu$, the projection of $\bmu$ on the column space of $\bX$. In general, $\bH \bmu \neq \bmu$, and the remaining part $\bmu - \bH \bmu$ is called __bias__. This is a new concept that will appear frequently in this book. Selection variables will essentially trade between bias and variance of a model. The following derivation shows this phenomenon:

\begin{align}
\E[\color{OrangeRed}{\text{Testing Error}}] =& ~\E \lVert \rby - \bX \bbbeta \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert \rby - \bH \bby \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert (\rby - \bmu) + (\bmu - \bH \bmu) + (\bH \bmu - \bH \bby) \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert \rby - \bmu \rVert^2 + \E \lVert \bmu - \bH \bmu \rVert^2 + \E \lVert \bH \bmu - \bH \bby  \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert \rbe \rVert^2 + \E \lVert \bmu - \bH \bmu \rVert^2 + \E \lVert \bH \bbe  \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\color{OrangeRed}{n \sigma^2} + \text{Bias}^2 + \color{DodgerBlue}{p \sigma^2},
\end{align}

while the training error is 

\begin{align}
\E[\color{DodgerBlue}{\text{Training Error}}] =& ~\E \lVert \bby - \bX \bbbeta \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert \bby - \bH \bby \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert (\bI - \bH)(\bmu + \bbe) \rVert^2 \\
=& ~\E \lVert (\bI - \bH)\bmu \rVert^2 + \E \lVert (\bI - \bH)\bbe \rVert^2\\
=& ~\text{Bias}^2 + \color{DodgerBlue}{(n - p) \sigma^2}.
\end{align}

We can notice again that the difference is $2p\sigma^2$. Note that this is regardless of whether the linear model is correct or not.
