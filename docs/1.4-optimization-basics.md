# Optimizations in `R'

**TODO:** Instead of specifically considering regression, change the focus of this chapter to modeling, with regression as an example.

This chapter will recap the basics of performing regression analyses in `R`. For more detailed coverage, see [Applied Statistics with `R`](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/).

We will use the [Advertising data](data/Advertising.csv) associated with [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html).


```r
library(readr)
Advertising = read_csv("data/Advertising.csv")
```

After loading data into `R`, our first step should **always** be to inspect the data. We will start by simply printing some observations in order to understand the basic structure of the data.


```r
Advertising
```

```
## # A tibble: 200 x 4
##       TV Radio Newspaper Sales
##    <dbl> <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl>
##  1 230.   37.8      69.2  22.1
##  2  44.5  39.3      45.1  10.4
##  3  17.2  45.9      69.3   9.3
##  4 152.   41.3      58.5  18.5
##  5 181.   10.8      58.4  12.9
##  6   8.7  48.9      75     7.2
##  7  57.5  32.8      23.5  11.8
##  8 120.   19.6      11.6  13.2
##  9   8.6   2.1       1     4.8
## 10 200.    2.6      21.2  10.6
## # ... with 190 more rows
```

Because the data was read using `read_csv()`, `Advertising` is a tibble. We see that there are a total of 200 observations and 4 variables, each of which is numeric. (Specifically double-precision vectors, but more importantly they are numbers.) For the purpose of this analysis, `Sales` will be the **response variable**. That is, we seek to understand the relationship between `Sales`, and the **predictor variables**: `TV`, `Radio`, and `Newspaper`.

## A simple optimization problem

After investigating the structure of the data, the next step should be to visualize the data. Since we have only numeric variables, we should consider **scatter plots**.
