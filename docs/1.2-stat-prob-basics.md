# Basics of Probability and Statistics

## Random Number Generation 

Random number generation is important for statistical simulation. R provides random number generators for many commonly used distributions, such as binomial (`rbinom`), normal (`rnorm`), t (`rt`) etc. The syntax is usually a letter "r" followed by the name of the distribution. 


```r
    # generate 10 independent Bernoulli random variables as a vector
    rbinom(n=10, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
##  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
    # 4 independent random standard normal variables
    rnorm(n=4)
## [1] -0.14868630 -0.03086009  2.14017210  0.25368047
```

Setting the seed before generating random numbers will allow us to replicate the results when necessary. 

```r
    # after setting the seed, the two runs will generate exactly the same "random" numbers
    set.seed(1)
    rnorm(n=4, mean = 1, sd = 2)
## [1] -0.2529076  1.3672866 -0.6712572  4.1905616
    set.seed(1)
    rnorm(n=4, mean = 1, sd = 2)
## [1] -0.2529076  1.3672866 -0.6712572  4.1905616
```

## Summary Statistics and Data Exploration

Statistical functions that provides a summary of the data

```r
    x = rnorm(n=100, mean = 1, sd = 2)
    y = rnorm(n=100, mean = 2, sd = 1)
    sum(x)
## [1] 118.4815
    mean(x)
## [1] 1.184815
    var(x)
## [1] 3.142351
    median(x)
## [1] 1.148906
    quantile(x, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
##       25%       50%       75% 
## 0.0115149 1.1489063 2.2746083
    cor(x, y)
## [1] -0.04261199
```

For discrete data, we can use the table function

```r
    library(ElemStatLearn)
    data(SAheart)
    table(SAheart$famhist)
## 
##  Absent Present 
##     270     192
    table(SAheart[, c("famhist","chd")])
##          chd
## famhist     0   1
##   Absent  206  64
##   Present  96  96
```

## Summary Statistics and Data Exploration

Fisher's exact test and the Chi-square test are tests of independence between two nominal variables.


```r
    # We can test the association between family history (famhist) and 
    # the indicator of coronary heart disease (chd)
    # using Fisher's Exact
    fisher.test(table(SAheart[, c("famhist","chd")]))
## 
## 	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data
## 
## data:  table(SAheart[, c("famhist", "chd")])
## p-value = 6.658e-09
## alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  2.119573 4.891341
## sample estimates:
## odds ratio 
##   3.209996

    # or the Chi-square test
    chisq.test(table(SAheart[, c("famhist","chd")]))
## 
## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction
## 
## data:  table(SAheart[, c("famhist", "chd")])
## X-squared = 33.123, df = 1, p-value = 8.653e-09
```

For continuous variables, data visualization can be very helpful. There are many different ways to customize a plot, such as changing the color, shape, label, etc. For more advanced features, the R package `ggplot2` is a very popular choice. 

```r
    # We use the birthrate data introduced earlier for this example
    birthrate = read.csv("data/birthrate.csv")
    plot(birthrate, pch = 19, col = "darkorange", ylab = "Birth Rate",
         main = "U.S. birth rate (1917 - 2003, per 10000)")
```

Correlations and correlation plots can be used to summarize more varaibles. However, becareful that factors may not be supported by this feature and could cause errors. 

```r
    suppressMessages(library(PerformanceAnalytics))
    chart.Correlation(SAheart[, c(1:3)], histogram=TRUE, pch="+")
```

\section{5. Regression Models}

A simple linear regression assumes the underlying model $$Y = \beta X + \epsilon.$$ With observed data, we can estimate the regression coefficients:

```r
    # the lm() function is the most commonly used
    fit = lm(y~x)
    summary(fit)
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ x)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1.9355 -0.6563 -0.1596  0.5764  2.3170 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)  2.03700    0.11874  17.156   <2e-16 ***
## x           -0.02359    0.05588  -0.422    0.674    
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 0.9856 on 98 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.001816,	Adjusted R-squared:  -0.00837 
## F-statistic: 0.1783 on 1 and 98 DF,  p-value: 0.6738
```

\section{6. Data Visualization}
A graphical view usually helps understand the data better. There are a variety of ways to customize your plot, such as color and shape.


```r
    plot(x, y, xlab = "x", ylab = "y", main = "A plot", col = "darkorange", pch = 19)
    abline(a = fit$coefficients[1], b = fit$coefficients[2], 
           col = "deepskyblue", lty = 2, lwd = 2)
    legend("topleft", c("observed points", "fitted line"), lty = c(NA, 2), 
           pch = c(19, NA), col = c("darkorange", "deepskyblue"))
```

\section{7. Other Things}

\subsection{7.1 Read-in and Save Data}
R can read-in data from many different sources such as \texttt{.txt}, \texttt{.csv}, etc. For example, \texttt{read.csv()} can be used to import \texttt{.csv} files. The first argument should be specified as the path to the data file, or just the name of the file if the current working directory is the same as the data file. R objects, especially matrices, can be saved into these standard files. Use functions such as \texttt{write.table()} and \texttt{write.csv} to perform this. We can also save any object into \texttt{.RData} file, which can be loaded later on. To do this try functions \texttt{save.image()} and \texttt{save()}.

\subsection{7.2 R Packages}
One of the most important features of R is its massive collection of packages. A package is like an add-on that can be downloaded and installed and perform additional function and analysis. 

```r
    # The MASS package can be used to generate multivariate normal distribution 
    library(MASS)
    P = 4; N = 200
    V <- 0.5^abs(outer(1:P, 1:P, "-"))
    X = as.matrix(mvrnorm(N, mu=rep(0,P), Sigma=V))
    head(X, 3)
##           [,1]       [,2]       [,3]       [,4]
## [1,]  1.233066  1.5191953  2.2469074  1.5273147
## [2,] -2.238075 -1.8347564 -1.4593319 -1.8318204
## [3,] -1.181232 -0.3395079  0.2223336 -0.8824585
```








# Modeling Basics in `R`

**TODO:** Instead of specifically considering regression, change the focus of this chapter to modeling, with regression as an example.

This chapter will recap the basics of performing regression analyses in `R`. For more detailed coverage, see [Applied Statistics with `R`](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/).

We will use the [Advertising data](data/Advertising.csv) associated with [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html).


```r
library(readr)
Advertising = read_csv("data/Advertising.csv")
```

After loading data into `R`, our first step should **always** be to inspect the data. We will start by simply printing some observations in order to understand the basic structure of the data.


```r
Advertising
```

```
## # A tibble: 200 x 4
##       TV Radio Newspaper Sales
##    <dbl> <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl>
##  1 230.   37.8      69.2  22.1
##  2  44.5  39.3      45.1  10.4
##  3  17.2  45.9      69.3   9.3
##  4 152.   41.3      58.5  18.5
##  5 181.   10.8      58.4  12.9
##  6   8.7  48.9      75     7.2
##  7  57.5  32.8      23.5  11.8
##  8 120.   19.6      11.6  13.2
##  9   8.6   2.1       1     4.8
## 10 200.    2.6      21.2  10.6
## # ... with 190 more rows
```

Because the data was read using `read_csv()`, `Advertising` is a tibble. We see that there are a total of 200 observations and 4 variables, each of which is numeric. (Specifically double-precision vectors, but more importantly they are numbers.) For the purpose of this analysis, `Sales` will be the **response variable**. That is, we seek to understand the relationship between `Sales`, and the **predictor variables**: `TV`, `Radio`, and `Newspaper`.

## Visualization for Regression

After investigating the structure of the data, the next step should be to visualize the data. Since we have only numeric variables, we should consider **scatter plots**.

We could do so for any individual predictor.


```r
plot(Sales ~ TV, data = Advertising, col = "dodgerblue", pch = 20, cex = 1.5,
     main = "Sales vs Television Advertising")
```

<img src="1.2-stat-prob-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" />

The `pairs()` function is a useful way to quickly visualize a number of scatter plots.


```r
pairs(Advertising)
```

<img src="1.2-stat-prob-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" />

Often, we will be most interested in only the relationship between each predictor and the response. For this, we can use the `featurePlot()` function from the `caret` package. (We will use the `caret` package more and more frequently as we introduce new topics.)


```r
library(caret)
featurePlot(x = Advertising[ , c("TV", "Radio", "Newspaper")], y = Advertising$Sales)
```

<img src="1.2-stat-prob-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="960" />

We see that there is a clear increase in `Sales` as `Radio` or `TV` are increased. The relationship between `Sales` and `Newspaper` is less clear. How all of the predictors work together is also unclear, as there is some obvious correlation between `Radio` and `TV`. To investigate further, we will need to model the data.


## The `lm()` Function {#sec:lm}

The following code fits an additive **linear model** with `Sales` as the response and each remaining variable as a predictor. Note, by not using `attach()` and instead specifying the `data = ` argument, we are able to specify this model without using each of the variable names directly.


```r
mod_1 = lm(Sales ~ ., data = Advertising)
# mod_1 = lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper, data = Advertising)
```

Note that the commented line is equivalent to the line that is run, but we will often use the `response ~ .` syntax when possible.


## Hypothesis Testing

The `summary()` function will return a large amount of useful information about a model fit using `lm()`. Much of it will be helpful for hypothesis testing including individual tests about each predictor, as well as the significance of the regression test.


```r
summary(mod_1)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = Sales ~ ., data = Advertising)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -8.8277 -0.8908  0.2418  1.1893  2.8292 
## 
## Coefficients:
##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)  2.938889   0.311908   9.422   <2e-16 ***
## TV           0.045765   0.001395  32.809   <2e-16 ***
## Radio        0.188530   0.008611  21.893   <2e-16 ***
## Newspaper   -0.001037   0.005871  -0.177     0.86    
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 1.686 on 196 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.8972,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8956 
## F-statistic: 570.3 on 3 and 196 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```


```r
mod_0 = lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio, data = Advertising)
```

The `anova()` function is useful for comparing two models. Here we compare the full additive model, `mod_1`, to a reduced model `mod_0`. Essentially we are testing for the significance of the `Newspaper` variable in the additive model.


```r
anova(mod_0, mod_1)
```

```
## Analysis of Variance Table
## 
## Model 1: Sales ~ TV + Radio
## Model 2: Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper
##   Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(>F)
## 1    197 556.91                           
## 2    196 556.83  1  0.088717 0.0312 0.8599
```

Note that hypothesis testing is *not* our focus, so we omit many details.


## Prediction

The `predict()` function is an extremely versatile function, for, prediction. When used on the result of a model fit using `lm()` it will, by default, return predictions for each of the data points used to fit the model. (Here, we limit the printed result to the first 10.)


```r
head(predict(mod_1), n = 10)
```

```
##         1         2         3         4         5         6         7 
## 20.523974 12.337855 12.307671 17.597830 13.188672 12.478348 11.729760 
##         8         9        10 
## 12.122953  3.727341 12.550849
```

Note that the effect of the `predict()` function is dependent on the input to the function. Here, we are supplying as the first argument a model object of class `lm`. Because of this, `predict()` then runs the `predict.lm()` function. Thus, we should use `?predict.lm()` for details.

We could also specify new data, which should be a data frame or tibble with the same column names as the predictors.


```r
new_obs = data.frame(TV = 150, Radio = 40, Newspaper = 1)
```

We can then use the `predict()` function for point estimates, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals.

Using only the first two arguments, `R` will simply return a point estimate, that is, the "predicted value," $\hat{y}$.


```r
predict(mod_1, newdata = new_obs)
```

```
##        1 
## 17.34375
```

If we specify an additional argument `interval` with a value of `"confidence"`, `R` will return a 95% confidence interval for the mean response at the specified point. Note that here `R` also gives the point estimate as `fit`.


```r
predict(mod_1, newdata = new_obs, interval = "confidence")
```

```
##        fit      lwr      upr
## 1 17.34375 16.77654 17.91096
```

Lastly, we can alter the level using the `level` argument. Here we report a prediction interval instead of a confidence interval.


```r
predict(mod_1, newdata = new_obs, interval = "prediction", level = 0.99)
```

```
##        fit      lwr      upr
## 1 17.34375 12.89612 21.79138
```


## Unusual Observations

`R` provides several functions for obtaining metrics related to unusual observations.

- `resid()` provides the residual for each observation
- `hatvalues()` gives the leverage of each observation
- `rstudent()` give the studentized residual for each observation
- `cooks.distance()` calculates the influence of each observation


```r
head(resid(mod_1), n = 10)
```

```
##           1           2           3           4           5           6

```


## Adding Complexity

We have a number of ways to add complexity to a linear model, even allowing a linear model to be used to model non-linear relationships.

### Interactions

Interactions can be introduced to the `lm()` procedure in a number of ways.

We can use the `:` operator to introduce a single interaction of interest.


```r
mod_2 = lm(Sales ~ . + TV:Newspaper, data = Advertising)
coef(mod_2)
```

```
##   (Intercept)            TV         Radio     Newspaper  TV:Newspaper 
##  3.8730824491  0.0392939602  0.1901312252 -0.0320449675  0.0002016962
```

The `response ~ . ^ k` syntax can be used to model all `k`-way interactions. (As well as the appropriate lower order terms.) Here we fit a model with all two-way interactions, and the lower order main effects.


```r
mod_3 = lm(Sales ~ . ^ 2, data = Advertising)
coef(mod_3)
```

```
##     (Intercept)              TV           Radio       Newspaper 
##    6.460158e+00    2.032710e-02    2.292919e-02    1.703394e-02 
##        TV:Radio    TV:Newspaper Radio:Newspaper 
##    1.139280e-03   -7.971435e-05   -1.095976e-04
```

The `*` operator can be used to specify all interactions of a certain order, as well as all lower order terms according to the usual hierarchy. Here we see a three-way interaction and all lower order terms.


```r
mod_4 = lm(Sales ~ TV * Radio * Newspaper, data = Advertising)
coef(mod_4)
```

```
##        (Intercept)                 TV              Radio 
##       6.555887e+00       1.971030e-02       1.962160e-02 
##          Newspaper           TV:Radio       TV:Newspaper 
##       1.310565e-02       1.161523e-03      -5.545501e-05 
##    Radio:Newspaper TV:Radio:Newspaper 
##       9.062944e-06      -7.609955e-07
```

Note that, we have only been dealing with numeric predictors. **Categorical predictors** are often recorded as **factor** variables in `R`. 


```r
library(tibble)
cat_pred = tibble(
  x1 = factor(c(rep("A", 10), rep("B", 10), rep("C", 10))),
  x2 = runif(n = 30),
  y  = rnorm(n = 30)
)
cat_pred
```

```
## # A tibble: 30 x 3
##    x1        x2      y
##    <fct>  <dbl>  <dbl>
##  1 A     0.528   2.04 
##  2 A     0.472  -0.326
##  3 A     0.0482  0.774

Notice that in this simple simulated tibble, we have coerced `x1` to be a factor variable, although this is not strictly necessary since the variable took values `A`, `B`, and `C`. When using `lm()`, even if not a factor, `R` would have treated `x1` as such. Coercion to factor is more important if a categorical variable is coded for example as `1`, `2` and `3`. Otherwise it is treated as numeric, which creates a difference in the regression model.

The following two models illustrate the effect of factor variables on linear models.


```r
cat_pred_mod_add = lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = cat_pred)
coef(cat_pred_mod_add)
```

```
## (Intercept)         x1B         x1C          x2 
## 0.007280546 0.067302562 0.142073630 0.400090509
```


```r
cat_pred_mod_int = lm(y ~ x1 * x2, data = cat_pred)
coef(cat_pred_mod_int)
```

```
## (Intercept)         x1B         x1C          x2      x1B:x2      x1C:x2 
## -0.48153539  1.20529786  0.13474064  1.76290161 -3.14845764 -0.05720444
```


### Polynomials

Polynomial terms can be specified using the inhibit function `I()` or through the `poly()` function. Note that these two methods produce different coefficients, but the same residuals! This is due to the `poly()` function using orthogonal polynomials by default.


```r
mod_5 = lm(Sales ~ TV + I(TV ^ 2), data = Advertising)
coef(mod_5)
```

```
##   (Intercept)            TV       I(TV^2) 
##  6.114120e+00  6.726593e-02 -6.846934e-05
```

```r
mod_6 = lm(Sales ~ poly(TV, degree = 2), data = Advertising)
coef(mod_6)
```

```
##           (Intercept) poly(TV, degree = 2)1 poly(TV, degree = 2)2 
##             14.022500             57.572721             -6.228802
```

```r
all.equal(resid(mod_5), resid(mod_6))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Polynomials and interactions can be mixed to create even more complex models.


```r
mod_7 = lm(Sales ~ . ^ 2 + poly(TV, degree = 3), data = Advertising)
# mod_7 = lm(Sales ~ . ^ 2 + I(TV ^ 2) + I(TV ^ 3), data = Advertising)
coef(mod_7)
```

```
##           (Intercept)                    TV                 Radio 
##          6.206394e+00          2.092726e-02          3.766579e-02 
##             Newspaper poly(TV, degree = 3)1 poly(TV, degree = 3)2 
##          1.405289e-02                    NA         -9.925605e+00 
## poly(TV, degree = 3)3              TV:Radio          TV:Newspaper 
##          5.309590e+00          1.082074e-03         -5.690107e-05 
##       Radio:Newspaper 
##         -9.924992e-05
```

Notice here that `R` ignores the first order term from `poly(TV, degree = 3)` as it is already in the model. We could consider using the commented line instead.


### Transformations

Note that we could also create more complex models, which allow for non-linearity, using transformations. Be aware, when doing so to the response variable, that this will affect the units of said variable. You may need to un-transform to compare to non-transformed models.


```r
mod_8 = lm(log(Sales) ~ ., data = Advertising)
sqrt(mean(resid(mod_8) ^ 2)) # incorrect RMSE for Model 8
```

```
## [1] 0.1849483
```

```r
sqrt(mean(resid(mod_7) ^ 2)) # RMSE for Model 7
```

```
## [1] 0.4813215
```

```r
sqrt(mean(exp(resid(mod_8)) ^ 2)) # correct RMSE for Model 8
```

```
## [1] 1.023205
```
