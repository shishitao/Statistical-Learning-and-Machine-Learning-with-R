## Resources and Guides

There are many online resources for how to use R, RStudio, and R Markdown. For example, David Dalpiaz's other online book [Applied Statistics with R](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) contains an introduction to using them. There are also other online documentation such as 

* [Install R and RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs&t=19s/)
* [R tutorial](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction)
* [Data in R Play-list (video)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBgxzZMu3GpPojVSoriMTWQCUno_3hjNi)
* [R and RStudio Play-list (video)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBgxzZMu3GpMjYhX7jLm5B9gEV7AOOJ5w)
* [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

It is worth to mention that once you become a developer of R packages using `C/C++` (add-on of R for performing specific tasks), and you also happen to use Windows like I do, you have to install this [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) that contains compilers. This is also needed if you want to manually install any R package using a "source" (`.tar.gz` files) instead of using the so-called "binaries" (`.zip` files). 

## Basic Mathematical Operations

We will briefly cover some basic R calculations and operations. If you want to see more information about a particular function or operator in R, the easiest way is to get the reference document. Put a question mark in front of a function name:


```r
    # In a default R console window, this will open up a web browser.
    # In RStudio, this will be displayed at the ‘Help’ window at the bottom-right penal. 
    ?log2
    ?matrix
```

Try type-in the following commands into your R console and start to explore yourself. Most of them are self-explanatory. Lines with a `#` in the front are comments, which will not be executed. Lines with `##` in the front are outputs. 


```r
    # Basic mathematical operations
    1 + 3
## [1] 4
    3*5
## [1] 15
    3^5
## [1] 243
    exp(2)
## [1] 7.389056
    log(3)
## [1] 1.098612
    log2(3)
## [1] 1.584963
    factorial(5)
## [1] 120
```

## Data Objects

Data objects can be a complicated topic for people who never used R before. Most common data objects are `vector`, `matrix`, `list`, and `data.frame`. Operations on vectors are matrices are fairly intuitive.


```r
    # creating a vector
    c(1,2,3,4)
## [1] 1 2 3 4
    c("a", "b", "c")
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
    # creating matrix from a vector
    matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2)
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    3
## [2,]    2    4
    x = c(1,1,1,0,0,0); y = c(1,0,1,0,1,0)
    cbind(x,y)
##      x y
## [1,] 1 1
## [2,] 1 0
## [3,] 1 1
## [4,] 0 0
## [5,] 0 1
## [6,] 0 0
    # matrix multiplication using '%*%'
    matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2) %*% t(cbind(x,y))
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
## [1,]    4    1    4    0    3    0
## [2,]    6    2    6    0    4    0
```

Simple mathematical operations on vectors and matrices are usually element-wise. You can easily extract certain elements of them by using the `[]` operator, like a `C` programming reference style. 


```r
    # some simple operations 
    x[3]
## [1] 1
    x[2:5]
## [1] 1 1 0 0
    cbind(x,y)[1:2, ]
##      x y
## [1,] 1 1
## [2,] 1 0
    (x + y)^2
## [1] 4 1 4 0 1 0
    length(x)
## [1] 6
    dim(cbind(x,y))
## [1] 6 2
    # A warning will be issued when R detects something wrong. Results may still be produced.
    x + c(1,2,3,4)
## Warning in x + c(1, 2, 3, 4): longer object length is not a multiple of shorter
## object length
## [1] 2 3 4 4 1 2
```

`list()` simply creates a list of objects (of any type). However, some operators cannot be directly applied to a list in a similar way as to vectors or matrices. Model fitting results in R are usually stored as a list (for example, the `lm()` function used in Section \@ref(sec:lm).


```r
    # creating a list
    x = list(c(1,2), "hello", matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2))
    x[[1]]
## [1] 1 2
```

`data.frame()` creates a list of vectors of equal length, and display them as a matrix-like object where each vector is a column of the matrix. It is mainly used for storing data. For example the famous iris data. The first four columns are numerical variables, while the last column is a categorical variable with three levels: `setosa`, `versicolor`, and `virginica`.


```r
    # the head function peeks the first several rows of the dataset 
    head(iris, n = 3)
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
    # data frame can be called by each individual column
    iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)]
## [1] setosa     versicolor virginica 
## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica
    # the summary function can be used to view all variables
    summary(iris)
##   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   
##  Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  
##  1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  
##  Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  
##  Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  
##  3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  
##  Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  
##        Species  
##  setosa    :50  
##  versicolor:50  
##  virginica :50  
##                 
##                 
## 
```

## Read-in Data from Other Sources

Data can be imported from a variety of sources. More commonly, a dataset can be stored in `.txt`, `.csv` or other file formats. 

```r
    # read-in data
    birthrate = read.csv("data/birthrate.csv")
    head(birthrate)
##   Year Birthrate
## 1 1917     183.1
## 2 1918     183.9
## 3 1919     163.1
## 4 1920     179.5
## 5 1921     181.4
## 6 1922     173.4
    # to see how many observations (rows) and variables (columns) in a dataset
    dim(birthrate)
## [1] 87  2
```

R data can also be saved into other formats. The more efficient way, assuming that you are going to load these file back to R in the future, is to save them as `.RData` file. Usually, for a large dataset, this reduces the time spend on reading in the data. 

```r
    # saving a object to .RData file
    save(birthrate, file = "mydata.RData")
    # you can specify multiple objects too
    save(birthrate, iris, file = "mydata.RData")
    # load the data again
    load("mydata.RData")
    # save data to .csv file
    write.csv(birthrate, file = "mydata.csv")
```

## Using Packages

Packages are written and contributed to R by individuals. They provide additional features (functions or data) that serve particular needs. The package `ElemStatLearn` is created for the textbook [@hastie2001elements] and contains may popular datasets. A package needs to be installed and loaded to your local computer. 


```r
    # install packages
    install.packages("ElemStatLearn")
    # load package
    library(ElemStatLearn)
```




```r
    # load a dataset from the package 
    data(SAheart)
    head(SAheart)

## 2 144    0.01 4.41     28.61  Absent    55   28.87    2.06  63   1

## 5 134   13.60 3.50     27.78 Present    60   25.99   57.34  49   1
## 6 132    6.20 6.47     36.21 Present    62   30.77   14.14  45   0
```

## Explore Yourself

There is no guide that can exhaust all information. I found the best learning approach is to perform a specific task and google your way to the success. Oftentimes, Stack Overflow is my best friend, especially when I am developing new packages. Also, read the reference manual carefully if you use a particular package or function. A reference manual (for packages on CRAN) can always be found at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/package_name](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/package_name).
