# Basics of Probability and Statistics

## Random Number Generation 

Random number generation is important for statistical simulation. R provides random number generators for many commonly used distributions, such as binomial (`rbinom`), normal (`rnorm`), t (`rt`) etc. The syntax is usually a letter "r" followed by the name of the distribution. 


```r
    # generate 10 independent Bernoulli random variables as a vector
    rbinom(n=10, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/1.3-stat-prob-basics.md
##  [1] 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1
    # 4 independent random standard normal variables
    rnorm(n=4)
## [1]  1.0965421 -1.0708139 -1.2199381 -0.3518751
=======
##  [1] 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
    # 4 independent random standard normal variables
    rnorm(n=4)
## [1] -0.3894331  0.5683866  1.3121476  2.6499437

```

Setting the seed before generating random numbers will allow us to replicate the results when necessary. 

```r
    # after setting the seed, the two runs will generate exactly the same "random" numbers
    set.seed(1)
    rnorm(n=4, mean = 1, sd = 2)
## [1] -0.2529076  1.3672866 -0.6712572  4.1905616
    set.seed(1)
    rnorm(n=4, mean = 1, sd = 2)
## [1] -0.2529076  1.3672866 -0.6712572  4.1905616
```

Some more complicated distributions require additional packages. For example, the `MASS` package can be used to generate the multivariate normal distribution. One needs to specify a vector of means and an invertable covariance matrix. 

```r
    library(MASS)
    P = 4
    V <- 0.5^abs(outer(1:P, 1:P, "-"))
    mvrnorm(3, mu=1:P, Sigma=V)
##           [,1]      [,2]     [,3]     [,4]
## [1,] 2.3075926 0.6273378 2.875879 3.515928
## [2,] 1.8215099 3.1535552 2.918031 4.528882
## [3,] 0.2549359 1.6922485 2.920198 3.623822
```

## Summary Statistics and Data Visualization

Statistical functions that provide a summary of the data.


```r
    x = rnorm(n=100, mean = 1, sd = 2)
    y = rnorm(n=100, mean = 2, sd = 1)
    sum(x)
## [1] 123.9597
    mean(x)
## [1] 1.239597
    var(x)
## [1] 3.12596
    median(x)
## [1] 1.116457
    quantile(x, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
##       25%       50%       75% 
## 0.0115149 1.1164572 2.3955519
    cor(x, y)
## [1] 0.05988467
```

For discrete data, we can use the table function.


```r
    library(ElemStatLearn)
    data(SAheart)
    table(SAheart$famhist)
## 
##  Absent Present 
##     270     192
    table(SAheart[, c("famhist","chd")])
##          chd
## famhist     0   1
##   Absent  206  64
##   Present  96  96
```

Fisher's exact test and the Chi-square test are tests of independence between two nominal variables.


```r
    # We can test the association between family history (famhist) and 
    # the indicator of coronary heart disease (chd)
    # using Fisher's Exact
    fisher.test(table(SAheart[, c("famhist","chd")]))
## 
## 	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data
## 
## data:  table(SAheart[, c("famhist", "chd")])
## p-value = 6.658e-09
## alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  2.119573 4.891341
## sample estimates:
## odds ratio 
##   3.209996

    # or the Chi-square test
    chisq.test(table(SAheart[, c("famhist","chd")]))
## 
## 	Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction
## 
## data:  table(SAheart[, c("famhist", "chd")])
## X-squared = 33.123, df = 1, p-value = 8.653e-09
```

For continuous variables, data visualization can be very helpful. There are many different ways to customize a plot, such as changing the color, shape, label, etc. For more advanced features, the R package `ggplot2` is a very popular choice. 

```r
    # We use the birthrate data introduced earlier for this example
    birthrate = read.csv("data/birthrate.csv")
    plot(birthrate, pch = 19, col = "darkorange", ylab = "Birth Rate",
         main = "U.S. birth rate (1917 - 2003, per 10000)")
```

Correlations and correlation plots can be used to summarize more variables. However, be careful that factors may not be supported by this feature and could cause errors. 

```r
    # load the package with loading message suppressed
    suppressMessages(library(PerformanceAnalytics))
    chart.Correlation(SAheart[, c(1:3)], histogram=TRUE, pch="+")
```

3-dimensional plot is  also an alternative to visualize data. We demonstrate an example using the `plot3D` package and the `scatter3D` function. The observations are colored by the outcome class (`chd`). The package `rgl` can allow for an interactive plot with rotating and zooming. 


```r
    library(plot3D)
    scatter3D(SAheart$ldl, SAheart$age, log(1+SAheart$tobacco), 
              xlab = "LDL", ylab = "Age", zlab = "Tobacco",
              pch = 18, bty = "u", col.var = SAheart$chd, 
              col = ifelse(SAheart$chd == 1, "darkorange", "deepskyblue"),
              colkey = FALSE)
```
