# (PART) Basics Knowledge {-}



# R and RStudio

The first step is to download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Most steps should be self-explanatory. You can also find many online guides for step-by-step instruction, such as [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs&t=19s/). However, be aware that some details may have been changed over the years. 

After installing both, open your RStudio, you should see four panes: 

  * Source pane on top-left where you write code in to files
  * Console on bottom-left where the code is inputted into R
  * Environment (and other tabs) on top-right where you can see current variables and objects you defined
  * File (and other tabs) on bottom-right which is essentially a file borrower

We will mainly use the left two panes. You can either directly input code into the console to run for results, or edit your code in a file and run them in chunks or as a whole. 

## Resources and Guides  {#r-basic}

There are many online resources for how to use R, RStudio. For example, David Dalpiaz's other online book [Applied Statistics with R](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) contains an introduction to using them. There are also other online documentation such as 

* [Install R and RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs&t=19s/)
* [R tutorial](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction)
* [Data in R Play-list (video)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBgxzZMu3GpPojVSoriMTWQCUno_3hjNi)
* [R and RStudio Play-list (video)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBgxzZMu3GpMjYhX7jLm5B9gEV7AOOJ5w)

It is worth to mention that once you become an advanced user, and possibly a developer of R packages using `C/C++` (add-on of R for performing specific tasks), and you also happen to use Windows like I do, you will have to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) that contains the gcc compilers. This is also needed if you want to install any R package from a "source" (`.tar.gz`) file instead of using the so-called "binaries" (`.zip` files). 

## Basic Mathematical Operations

Basic R calculations and operations should be self-explanatory. Try to type-in the following commands into your R console and start to explore yourself. Lines with a `#` in the front are comments, which will not be executed. Lines with `##` in the front are outputs you should expect. 


```r
    # Basic mathematical operations
    1 + 3
## [1] 4
    1 - 3
## [1] -2
    1 * 3
## [1] 3
    1 / 3
## [1] 0.3333333
    3^5
## [1] 243
    4^(-1/2)
## [1] 0.5
    pi
## [1] 3.141593
    
    # some math functions
    sqrt(4)
## [1] 2
    exp(1)
## [1] 2.718282
    log(3)
## [1] 1.098612
    log2(16)
## [1] 4
    log(15, base = 3)
## [1] 2.464974
    factorial(5)
## [1] 120
    sin(pi)
## [1] 1.224606e-16
```

If you want to see more information about a particular function or operator in R, the easiest way is to get the reference document. Put a question mark in front of a function name:


```r
    # In a default R console window, this will open up a web browser.
    # In RStudio, this will be displayed at the ‘Help’ window at the bottom-right penal (Help tab). 
    ?log10
    ?cos
```

## Data Objects

Data objects can be a complicated topic for people who never used R before. The most common data objects are `vector`, `matrix`, `list`, and `data.frame`. They are defined using a specific syntax. To define a vector, we use `c` followed by `()`, where the elements within the parenthesis are separated using comma. You can save the vector and name as something else. For example


```r
    # creating a vector
    c(1,2,3,4)
## [1] 1 2 3 4
    c("a", "b", "c")
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
    
    # define a new vector object, called `x`
    x = c(1,1,1,0,0,0)
```

After defining this object `x`, it should also appear on your top-right environment pane. To access elements in an object, we use the `[]` operator, like a `C` programming reference style.


```r
    # getting the second element in x
    x[2]
## [1] 1

    # getting the second to the fourth element in x
    x[2:4]
## [1] 1 1 0
```

Similarly, we can create and access matrices.


```r
    # create a matrix by providing all of its elements
    # the elements are filled to the matrix by column
    matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2)
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    3
## [2,]    2    4

    # create a matrix by column-bind vectors
    y = c(1,0,1,0,1,0)
    cbind(x, y)
##      x y
## [1,] 1 1
## [2,] 1 0
## [3,] 1 1
## [4,] 0 0
## [5,] 0 1
## [6,] 0 0

    # access elements in a matrix
    # Note that in R, upper and lower cases are treated as two different objects
    X = matrix(c(1:16), 4, 4)
    X
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,]    1    5    9   13
## [2,]    2    6   10   14
## [3,]    3    7   11   15
## [4,]    4    8   12   16
    X[2, 3]
## [1] 10
    X[1, ]
## [1]  1  5  9 13
    
    # getting a sub-matrix of X
    X[1:2, 3:4]
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    9   13
## [2,]   10   14
```

Simple mathematical operations on vectors and matrices are usually element-wise. For matrix multiplications, you should use `%*%`.


```r
    # adding two vectors
    (x + y)^2
## [1] 4 1 4 0 1 0

    # getting the length of a vector
    length(x)
## [1] 6
    
    # matrix multiplication
    X %*% X
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,]   90  202  314  426
## [2,]  100  228  356  484
## [3,]  110  254  398  542
## [4,]  120  280  440  600
    
    # getting the dimension of a matrix
    dim(X)
## [1] 4 4
    
    # A warning will be issued when R detects something wrong
    # Results may still be produced however
    y + c(1,2,3,4)
## Warning in y + c(1, 2, 3, 4): longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
## [1] 2 2 4 4 2 2
```

`list()` creates a list of objects (of any type). However, some operators cannot be directly applied to a list in a similar way as to vectors or matrices. Model fitting results in R are usually stored as a list (for example, the `lm()` function used in Chapter \@ref(linear-reg).


```r
    # creating a list
    x = list(c(1,2), "hello", matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2, 2))

    # accessing its elements using double brackets `[[]]` 
    x[[1]]
## [1] 1 2
```

`data.frame()` creates a list of vectors of equal length, and display them as a matrix-like object where each vector is a column of the matrix. It is mainly used for storing data. This will be our most frequently used data object. For example, in the famous `iris` data, the first four columns are numerical variables, while the last column is a categorical variable with three levels: `setosa`, `versicolor`, and `virginica`:


```r
    # The iris data is included with base R, so we can use them directly
    # This will create a copy of the data into your environment
    data(iris)

    # the head function peeks the first several rows of the dataset 
    head(iris, n = 3)
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
    
    # each column usually contains a column (variable) name 
    colnames(iris)
## [1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width"  "Species"
    
    # data frame can be called by each individual column, which will be a vector
    iris$Species
##   [1] setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     setosa     versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor versicolor

## Read-in Data from Other Sources

Data can be imported from a variety of sources. More commonly, a dataset can be stored in `.txt`, `.csv` or other file formats. 

```r
    # read-in data
    birthrate = read.csv("data/birthrate.csv")
    head(birthrate)
##   Year Birthrate
## 1 1917     183.1
## 2 1918     183.9
## 3 1919     163.1
## 4 1920     179.5
## 5 1921     181.4
## 6 1922     173.4
    # to see how many observations (rows) and variables (columns) in a dataset
    dim(birthrate)
## [1] 87  2
```

R data can also be saved into other formats. The more efficient way, assuming that you are going to load these file back to R in the future, is to save them as `.RData` file. Usually, for a large dataset, this reduces the time spend on reading in the data. 

```r
    # saving a object to .RData file
    save(birthrate, file = "mydata.RData")
    # you can specify multiple objects too
    save(birthrate, iris, file = "mydata.RData")
    # load the data again
    load("mydata.RData")
    # save data to .csv file
    write.csv(birthrate, file = "mydata.csv")
```

## Using Packages

Packages are written and contributed to R by individuals. They provide additional features (functions or data) that serve particular needs. The package `ElemStatLearn` is created for the textbook [@hastie2001elements] and contains may popular datasets. A package needs to be installed and loaded to your local computer. 


```r
    # install packages
    install.packages("ElemStatLearn")
    # load package
    library(ElemStatLearn)
```




```r
    # load a dataset from the package 
    data(SAheart)
    head(SAheart)

## Explore Yourself

There is no guide that can exhaust all information. I found the best learning approach is to perform a specific task and google your way to the success. Oftentimes, Stack Overflow is my best friend, especially when I am developing new packages. Also, read the reference manual carefully if you use a particular package or function. A reference manual (for packages on CRAN) can always be found at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/package_name](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/package_name).
